## FEA_Part_1_Beam_Design
<br>
### Assignment Description

The goal of this assignment is to design a beam in Onshape that would maximize the weight it could support before failing. In order to make the assignment more challenging, a variety of restrictions, and beam failures were classified as the beam either breaking or bending more than 35mm.

### Reflection

Before starting the design, I looked into architecture designs for strong yet light-weight designs. One of the most intriguing designs utilized a lattice for the main structure of the beam. By attaching a thinner chunk to the end of the main beam, I was able to make a shelf for the eyebolt hole. I also went through and filleted any sharp corners where different parts of the attachment block met in order to reduce any potential breaking points, since sharp corners are stress concentrators and curves are not. When designing the beam as a whole, I was reminded of a honeycomb, which may be a concept used in future iterations, especially since hexagons are particularly strong shapes.

## FEA_Part_2_Simcale_Workflow
<br>
### Assignment Description

The goal of this assignment is to test the designed beam in **SIMCALE** to test how strong the beam is, where the beam has weak points, and how much force it can withstand. The results are meant to simulate approximately real world results that saves time, and resources with having the extra ability to discover weak points needing reinforcements.

### Reflection

By running the design, I saw the area where the beam was the weakest(**being at the start of the beam**) which provided suffecient data in re-iterating the design and reinforcing the weakpoints which made the beam bend.
