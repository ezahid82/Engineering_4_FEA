## FEA_Part_1_Beam_Design

### Assignment Description

The goal of this assignment was to design a beam in Onshape that would maximize the weight it could support before failing. In order to make the assignment more challenging, we had a variety of restrictions, and beam failure was classified as the beam either breaking or bending more than 35mm.

### Reflection

Before starting my design, I looked into architecture designs for strong yet light-weight designs. One of the most intriguing designs utilized a lattice for the main structure of the beam. By attaching a thinner chunk to the end of the main beam, I was able to make a shelf for the eyebolt hole. I also went through and filleted any sharp corners where different parts of the attachment block met in order to reduce any potential breaking points, since sharp corners are stress concentrators and curves are not. When designing the beam as a whole, I was reminded of a honeycomb, which may be a concept used in future iterations, especially since hexagons are particularly strong shapes.
